  <img src="overview.png" width="1000">
</p>

Large language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities across a vast array of domains. In this report, we delve into the performance of **LLMs within the context of scientific discovery**, focusing on GPT-4. Our investigation spans a diverse range of scientific areas encompassing:
* [Drug discovery](#drug-discovery)
* [Biology](#biology)
* [Computational chemistry](#computational-chemistry) (density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD))
* [Materials design](#materials-design)
* [Partial differential equations](#partial-differential-equations) (PDE)

Our exploration methodology primarily consists of **expert-driven case assessments**, which offer qualitative insights into the model's comprehension of intricate scientific concepts and relationships, and occasionally **benchmark testing**, which quantitatively evaluates the model's capacity to solve well-defined domain-specific problems. Our preliminary exploration indicates that **GPT-4 exhibits promising potential for a variety of scientific applications, demonstrating its aptitude for handling complex problem-solving and knowledge integration tasks**. Broadly speaking, we evaluate GPT-4's knowledge base, scientific understanding, scientific numerical calculation abilities, and various scientific prediction capabilities.

# ‚ù§Ô∏èContribution Invitation (call for participation)

## Biology 
* üëç***Bioinformation Processing***: GPT-4 displays its understanding of information processing from specialized files in biological domains, such as MEME format, FASTQ format, and VCF format. Furthermore, it is adept at performing bioinformatic analysis with given tasks and data, exemplified by predicting the signaling peptides for a provided sequence.
* üëç***Biological Understanding***: GPT-4 demonstrates a broad understanding of various biological topics, encompassing consensus sequences, PPI, signaling pathways, and evolutionary concepts. 
* üëç***Biological Reasoning***: GPT-4 possesses the ability to reason about plausible mechanisms from biological observations using its built-in biological knowledge.
* üëç***Biological Assisting***: GPT-4 demonstrates its potential as a scientific assistant in the realm of protein design tasks, and in wet lab experiments by translating experimental protocols for automation purposes.
* üòµ***FASTA Sequence Understanding***: A notable challenge for GPT-4 is the direct processing of FASTA sequences. It is preferable to supply the names of biomolecules in conjunction with their sequences when possible.
* üòµ***Inconsistent Result***: GPT-4‚Äôs performance on tasks related to biological entities is influenced by the abundance of information pertaining to the entities. Analysis of under-studied entities, such as transcription factors, may yield inconsistent results.
